# Code of Conduct

This project is committed to a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community. We expect all participants to follow this Code of Conduct in all project spaces, including GitHub and our Discord server.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful, considerate, and constructive
- Welcoming questions and new contributors
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information
- Unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Spam, unsolicited self‑promotion, or advertising unrelated to the project

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces—GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, and our Discord server—as well as when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:
- Open a private report by contacting project maintainers via one of the following:
  - GitHub: open an issue labeled `conduct` (you may immediately request that maintainers move details to a private channel)
  - Discord: send a direct message to a maintainer or moderator listed in the server member list
- For urgent safety concerns, prioritize your safety and contact local authorities.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers will respect the reporter’s confidentiality to the extent possible and necessary to address the issue.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate. Common consequences include:
1. Correction: A private, written notice clarifying expected behavior
2. Warning: A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior
3. Temporary Ban: Temporary removal from community spaces
4. Permanent Ban: Permanent removal from community spaces

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (`https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html`).
